## Making a Clicker Game with C# Form
C# game codes are in [/ClickerGame/Form1.cs](https://github.com/AtakanTurgut/ClickerGameCSForm/blob/main/ClickerGame/Form1.cs).

You can win the game by buying all the items as soon as possible.
You can hover over the items and see their values.
Purchased items have a background color of Green and cannot be purchased again.
For starters, every click on the enemy earns 5G.
After purchasing all the items, "You Won!!!" will appear on the screen.
